2.2. Supply the missing cases for Theorem 2.19 and Lemma 2.20 having to do with
sequencing commands (c0 ; c1 ).
2.3. Supply the missing case for while-loops in Lemma 2.20. Hint: exploit Theorem 2.2.
2.4. Complete the small-step semantics in Figure 2.2 by giving all the missing rules
relating to boolean expressions. (The ones for conjunction are complete, and should
not be extended or modified.)
2.5. Prove Theorem 2.15 and Lemma 2.16 for the cases relating to conjunctions (EB-
AndT and EB-AndF vs. SB-And1, SB-AndT, and SB-AndF).
